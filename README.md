# Offerzen Dashboard Tech Assessment
## Approach


The aim of this assignment is to evaluate the basic technical competence you’ll require for this
position.
- For the frontend implementation you need to use React or an equivalent library.
- Feel free to make use of your preferred styling approach (regular CSS, CSS-in-JS, Sass
etc.), but do ensure that you make use of custom styles.
- There’s no need to create a fake backend for the data, you can just copy-paste the JSON
data and import it directly.
- Your work must be your own, and should be completed unassisted. Feel free, though, to
search the internet to look up any content.
- Communicate your thinking as much as possible. Add a README to communicate how to
run your solutions and any relevant notes, for example, any extra thoughts on the tasks or
how you structured your submissions.
- If you are stuck or are taking too much time, use your discretion to implement what is
important to the task at hand, and write out your challenges in the README.
